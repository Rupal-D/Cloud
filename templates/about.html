<h2><a class="article-title" > The world of data science is a tremendous one. The one who makes the best use of it benefits from it and spreads its essence to the world. Being a keen observer, I have a great interest in learning from data. And hence find data science as my cup of tea. Having studied statistics, mathematics, and computer science, I can put forth the concepts relevant in the field to real-world scenarios and give meaningful insights. Data science involves learning every day and my audacity to learn and do more of it paves the path for a committed journey as a data scientist.</a></h2>
